# Pagination Project - README

## 📚 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to paginate a dataset with simple `page` and `page_size` parameters  
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata  
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner  

---

## 📖 Description

This project focuses on implementing different pagination techniques for handling large datasets efficiently. Pagination is essential when working with APIs or databases to ensure performance and usability.

You will explore:

- Basic pagination using page numbers and page sizes  
- Advanced pagination using hypermedia (HATEOAS-style metadata)  
- Robust pagination that remains consistent even when data is modified or deleted  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Code should follow best practices and be well documented  
- All functions must be type-annotated  

---

## 🚀 Concepts Covered

### 1. Simple Pagination
Using `page` and `page_size` parameters, you will learn how to:
- Slice datasets  
- Return only the requested subset of data  
- Handle edge cases such as invalid input  

### 2. Hypermedia Pagination
You will enhance your pagination system by including metadata such as:
- Current page  
- Next page  
- Previous page  
- Total pages  

This makes your API more user-friendly and self-descriptive.

### 3. Deletion-Resilient Pagination
You will implement pagination that:
- Handles missing or deleted entries gracefully  
- Maintains consistency even when the dataset changes  
- Avoids skipping or duplicating items  

---

## 🧠 Expected Outcome

By completing this project, you should have a strong understanding of pagination strategies and be able to implement them in real-world applications, especially in APIs and backend systems.
